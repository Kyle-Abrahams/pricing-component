## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned to use flexbox in a better way to improve the responsiveness of my websites. Using react to help speed-up my JavaScript coding and keep all the code in components to help with debugging if needed

### Continued development

I want to speed up the CSS coding projects and keep my CSS as DRY as possible, and work on my layout skills to help with the responsiveness of my websites
